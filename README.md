# Modify-workspace-permissions-in-Dify-Community-Edition
To implement this project, replace the corresponding files in the Dify (version 0.15.3) source code with the files in the changed directory, or modify the mappings to map the files in the changed directory to the Dify source code to achieve the same effect.<br>
When pulling the source code of Dify Community Edition, only one workspace can exist on a single server (due to Dify's restriction). This workspace belongs to the first user, and other users must rely on invitations from the first user to join. These invited users can only access the first userâ€™s workspace and cannot have their own, which forces all work to be carried out in the same workspace.<br>
I modified the Dify source code so that invited users can also have their own workspaces (automatically created), and each workspace can freely invite existing users or new users. However, considering permission control (for example, sometimes we want new users to have their own workspace, and sometimes not), I added a restriction: only new users invited by the first user can have their own workspace, while new users invited by other users cannot.
